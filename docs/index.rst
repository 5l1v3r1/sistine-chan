Maid-chan Messenger Bot
=======================

Maid-chan Overview
==================

Maid-chan leverages the advantage of using Facebook Messenger API. It allows us to communicate and share our application
with billion of people around the world. It also eliminates the necessity of developing mobile and web application.

Maid-chan itself is not a general-purpose bot. If you like Japanese culture or have an interest in learning Japanese,
then Maid-chan will probably useful for you. Currently, it supports several basic features, such as simple chatbot,
daily scheduler for Kanji & Vocabulary of the day, daily greetings, RSS Feed notifier, and translation via Google Translate.
In addition, Maid-chan can be used as an intermediary between mobile and server-side, where you could leverage server
capability (CPU) for hard tasks such as Machine Learning (image processing).

Maid-chan is mainly written in Python.
