# Offerings

This directory is used to maintain list of images for daily offerings. There are two directories: `stock` and `used`. As the name suggests, Maid-chan will choose a random image from `stock`, send the image to all subscribers, and move the image to `used`.

If there is no more image in `stock`, Maid-chan will simply skip sending image in the daily offerings.
